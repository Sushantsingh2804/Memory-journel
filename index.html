          <p>Delhi, officially known as the National Capital Territory of Delhi (NCT), is a city and a
             union territory of India containing New Delhi,the capital of India.

             city in the world and first in India by foreign visitors in 2015.There are
             numerous tourist attractions in Delhi, both historic and modern. The three UNESCO World

         <h1>Ladakh</h1>
         <br><br>
         <p>Ladakh is a Himalayan region administered by India as a union territory.
        Located in the western Himalayas of northern India, the region has been the
        subject of dispute between India, Pakistan, and China since 1947. It is
        bordered by the Tibet Autonomous Region to the east, the Indian state of
        Himachal Pradesh to the south, both the Indian union territory of Jammu and
        Kashmir and the Pakistan-administered Gilgit-Baltistan to the west, and the
       southwest corner of Xinjiang across the Karakoram Pass in the far north. It
       extends from the Siachen Glacier in the Karakoram range to the north to the
      main Great Himalayas to the south.The eastern end, consisting of the
      uninhabited Aksai Chin plains, is claimed by the Indian Government as part of
      Ladakh, and has been under Chinese control since 1962.Until 2019, Ladakh was a
      region of the state of Jammu and Kashmir. In August 2019, the Parliament of
      India passed an act by which Ladakh became a union territory on 31 October 2019.
    In the past Ladakh gained importance from its strategic location at the crossroads
    of important trade routes, but since the Chinese authorities closed the
    borders between Tibet Autonomous Region and Ladakh in the 1960s, international
  trade has dwindled except for tourism. Since 1974, the Government of India has
   successfully encouraged tourism in Ladakh. Since Ladakh is a part of the
  strategically important Kashmir region, the Indian military maintains a strong
  presence in the region.</p>

      architectural guidance of Vidyadhar Bhattacharya, Jaipur was planned based
     on the principles of Vastu Shastra and Shilpa Shastra. The construction
      of the city began in 1726 and took four years to complete the major roads,
      offices, and palaces. The city was divided into nine blocks, two of which
    contained the state buildings and palaces, with the remaining seven allotted
    to the public. Huge ramparts were built, pierced by seven fortified gates.

          <h1>Agra</h1>
          <br><br>
          <p>Agra is a city on the banks of the Yamuna river in the Indian state
      of Uttar Pradesh. It is 206 kilometres (128 mi) south of the national
      capital New Delhi. Agra is the fourth-most populous city in Uttar Pradesh
and 24th in India.It has been speculated that the city mentioned in Mahabharata
 as Agravana which translates as “front of the forest” is the present day Agra.
 The Shurasena dynasty of Lord Krishna maintained an outpost at Agravana.
  Greek geographer Ptolemy referred to Agra by its modern name in his Geographia
  and placed it in his world map in the 2nd century AD.The 11th-century Persian
  poet Mas'ūd Sa'd Salmān writes of an assault on the fortress of Agra,then held
  by King Jaypal, by Mahmud of Ghazni. Despite his surrender, Mahmud sacked the
  place. A 17th century chronicle called Agra before Sikandar Lodī's time
  (1488–1517) as an old settlement which was merely a village, owing to its
  destruction by Mahmud of Ghazni. Sikandar was the first sultan to move his
  capital from Delhi to Agra in 1504, its administration having previously been
  under Bayana.He governed the country from here and Agra assumed the importance
  of the second capital. He died in 1517 and his son, Ibrāhīm Lodī, remained in
  power there for nine more years. Several palaces, wells, and a mosque were
  built by him in the fort during his period. He was defeated at the Battle of
  Panipat in 1526.Between 1540 and 1556, Afghans, beginning with Sher
  Shah Suri, ruled the area. It was the capital of the Mughal Empire from 1556
  to 1648. The city was later taken by the Marathas and later still fell to the
  British Raj.</p>

          <h1>Goa</h1>
          <br><br>
          <p>Goa is a state on the southwestern coast of India within the region
   known as the Konkan, and geographically separated from the Deccan highlands
  by the Western Ghats. It is surrounded by the Indian states of Maharashtra
  to the north and Karnataka to the east and south, with the Arabian Sea forming
its western coast. It is India's smallest state by area and the fourth-smallest
 by population. Goa has the highest GDP per capita among all Indian states,
 two and a half times that of the country. It was ranked the best-placed
 state by the Eleventh Finance Commission for its infrastructure and ranked on
 top for the best quality of life in India by the National Commission on
  Population based on the 12 Indicators.Panaji is the state's capital, while
  Vasco da Gama is its largest city. The historic city of Margao still exhibits
   the cultural influence of the Portuguese, who first landed in the early 16th
    century as merchants and conquered it soon thereafter. Goa was a former
     state of the Portuguese Empire. The Portuguese overseas territory of
      Portuguese India existed for about 450 years until it was annexed by
      India in 1961.Its majority and official language is Konkani.
    Rock art engravings found in Goa exhibit the earliest traces of human life
     in India.Goa, situated within the Shimoga-Goa Greenstone Belt in the
     Western Ghats (an area composed of metavolcanics, iron formations and
      ferruginous quartzite), yields evidence for Acheulean occupation.</p>

            <h1>Kedarnath</h1>
            <br><br>
             <p>Kēdārnāth Mandir (Kedarnath Temple) is a Hindu temple (shrine)
    dedicated to Lord Shiva (Mahadeva). Located on the Garhwal Himalayan range
    near the Mandakini river, Kedarnath is located in the state of Uttarakhand,
     India. Due to extreme weather conditions, the temple is open to the general
      public only between the months of April (Akshaya Tritiya) and November
       (Kartik Purnima, the autumn full moon). During the winters, the vigraha
    (deity) from Kedarnath temple is carried down to Ukhimath and where the
  deity is worshiped for the next six months. Kedarnath is seen as a homogenous
  form of Lord Shiva, the 'Lord of Kedarkhand', the historical name of the region.
  The temple is not directly accessible by road and has to be reached by a 22
  kilometres (14 mi) uphill trek from Gaurikund. Pony and manchan service is
  available to reach the structure. According to Hindu legends, the temple was
  initially built by Pandavas, and is one of the twelve Jyotirlingas, the
  holiest Hindu shrines of Shiva. It is one of the 275 Paadal Petra Sthalams,
   expounded in Tevaram.Pandavas were supposed to have pleased Shiva by doing
penance in Kedarnath. The temple is one of the four major sites in India's
Chota Char Dham pilgrimage of Northern Himalayas. This temple is the highest
among the 12 Jyotirlingas.Kedarnath was the worst affected area during the
 2013 flash floods in North India.  </p>
